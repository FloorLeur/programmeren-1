# Exercise: Algorithms

Get more comfortable with sorting algorithms. Each algorithm below intends to sort an array of integers into ascending order. Generally speaking, smaller elements in the array are moved to the "left" and larger elements are moved to the right, until they are in order.

## Swapping

In most of the sorting algorithms below, *swapping* is important. By swapping, we mean exchanging the values at two positions in an array.

## Selection sort

The following pseudocode describes the selection sort algorithm.

	sort array of length n:
		i : = 0
		while i < n:
			index_smallest := find index of smallest element in array between i and n
			swap values at index_smallest and i
			i := i + 1

Perform the procedure on the array below. Show every swap on an individual line and show which elements you're swapping by underlining them. Also show which part of the array is sorted on every line by drawing a rectangle around the sorted part of the array.

## Bubble sort

Consider the following pseudocode for bubble sort.

	sort array of lenth n:
		end := n - 1
		while array is not sorted:
			for i from 0 to end:
				if array[i] > array[i+1]:
					swap values at i and i + 1
			end := end - 1 

Perform the procedure on the array below. Show every swap on an individual line and show which elements you're swapping by underlining them.

## Insertion sort

Perform the procedure on the array below. Show every change on an individual line and show which elements you're swapping by underlining them. Also show which part of the array is sorted on every line by drawing a rectangle around the sorted part of the array.

## Merge sort

> This algorithm is based on recursion, which is not part of the course. The merge sort algorithm will not be on any of the tests.

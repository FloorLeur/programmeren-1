# Module 3: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn about arrays and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- TBA


## What to Do

#### 1. Preparation

Watch the lecture on [Algorithms](/lectures/algorithms)

#### 2. Find

Implement either of:

- [Find](/problems/find-less), for those less comfortable

- [Find](/problems/find-more), for those more comfortable

#### 3. Fifteen

Implement [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen)

#### 4. Exercises

Study and take the test:

- [Arrays](/exercises/arrays)

- [Loops](/exercises/loops)

#### 5. Submit

You can submit your solutions on the problem pages linked above. Before submitting, keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (like plagiarism).
